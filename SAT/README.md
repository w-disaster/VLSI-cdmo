# VLSI SAT

The SAT version can be launched:
- From the terminal using the python script in the ```src``` directory,
```./run_vlsi_sat.py -i instance_file_path -o output_file_path -r False```, specifying the path of the instance, the output file and if the rotation is enabled or not (in this case it's set to false).
- Using the python notebook through jupyter notebook (```jupyter-notebook VLSI_SAT.ipynb```) or Google Colab.
